The goal of the solunar project is to provide an open source Solunar Tables prediction solution.
Solunar Tables are used to predict the most active days and times of day for fish and game.
It will be  useful for fishing and hunting.


I have been unable to find in detail a clear explanation of when the solunar times actually occur.
For this prototype I am using the  following rules:

Minor Times last one hour and occur at moonrise and moonset.
Major Times last two hours and occur during the moon transits.
The current release will not report a Major or Minor time if it overlaps with the previous or next day.

Rules for daily action prediction:
Scale is 0-5 with 5 being the best, initially scale is set to 0.
	add 1 for each solunar period that occurs within 30 minutes of sunset or sunrise, max of 2.
	add 1 id day is with in approx 3 days of a new or full moon.
	add 2 if day is with in approx 2 days of a new or full moon.
	add 3 if day is a full or new moon.

Any of these rule may modified in future versions.


This release will ask the user for the following input:
	year
 	month
 	day
 	latitude
 	longitude
	time zone
and output the following:
	moon phase
 	moon rise
 	moon set
 	moon transit
 	sun rise
 	sun set
 	minor solunar times
 	major solunar times
	Daily action prediction scale, 0-5 with 5 being the best.
